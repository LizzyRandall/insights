Insights - An Open-Source Visualisation Platform for OBIEE
===

Insights is an add-on for [OBIEE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-enterprise-edition/overview/index.html) providing a customisable UI framework that allows you to build front end web applications that interface with the OBI back end.

Specifically, there's a visualisation builder and dashboard viewer that has been built using this framework and provides many UI features not present in the standard application.

To deploy the application please follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/RittmanMead/insights/wiki/Installation-Guide). Technical information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/RittmanMead/insights/wiki) for this project.

Note that Insights is only compatible with IE11, Chrome browsers and with OBIEE 11.1.1.9 and higher. Specific compatibility can be found in the [technical guide](https://github.com/RittmanMead/insights/wiki/Technical-Overview).
